Data Compression and Linear Optimization
========================================

Draft of a research paper of [Francesco Orabona](http://francesco.orabona.com/)
and [Dávid Pál](http://david.palenica.com/). We show connection between data
compression and online linear optimization. In particular, starting from
Krichevsky-Trofimov estimator for estimating the bias of a coin, we derive an
algorithm for online linear optimization over a Hilbert space.
