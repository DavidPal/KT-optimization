In the recent years a number of parameter-free algorithms have been developed in the areas of online linear optimization and online learning with expert advice. While these two family of algorithms might seem different to a distract eye, the proof methods are indeed very similar, making the reader wonder if such a connection is only accidental.

In this paper, we unify these two families, showing that both can be instantiated from the more general online coin betting algorithm. 
In particular, we prove that parameter-free algorithms for online linear optimization in Hilbert spaces can be obtained with a \emph{single} online coin betting algorithm, while paramter-free expert algorithms are nothing else that $d$ instantiations of online coin betting algorithms.
Besides advancing our understanding of parameter-free online learning algorithms, this framework allows to easily derive new algorithms from betting ones. We instantiate our framework using the Krichevsky-Trofimov estimator bettor and other known coin betting algorithm.
