In the recent years a number of parameter-free algorithms have been developed in the areas of online linear optimization and online learning with expert advice. While these two family of algorithms might seem different to a distract eye, the proof methods are indeed very similar, making the reader wonder if such a connection is only accidental.

In this paper, we unify these two families, showing that both are a simple instantiations of an online coin betting algorithm. In particular, we prove that parameter-free algorithms for online linear optimization in Hilbert spaces can be obtained with a \emph{single} online coin betting algorithm, while paramter-free expert algorithms are nothing else that $d$ instantiations of online coin betting algorithms.

%Starting from Krichevsky-Trofimov estimator for estimating
%the bias of a coin, we derive an algorithm for online linear
%optimization over a Hilbert space.
